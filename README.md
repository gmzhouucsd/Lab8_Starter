# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I would put my automated tests in a GitHub action that runs whenver code is pushed.
2. No
3. I wouldn't use unit testing for testing a "message" feature because it can't test how components like messages interact with each other.
4. I would use unit testing to test "max message length" because it's an individual component with not many moving parts.
